# Gym Trainer hack

A FireRed hack built on pokeemerald-expansion (FireRed mode). The player is training to become a
Gym Leader: they pick one type at the start and build their team, and later their own gym, around it.

## Getting the game

Every push to `main` builds the ROM automatically on GitHub:
**Actions** tab → latest **Build ROM** run → download **gym-trainer-hack-rom** under *Artifacts*
(it arrives as a .zip with `pokefirered.gba` inside). A build takes roughly 10-15 minutes.

Debug menu: hold **R** and press **Start** in the overworld.

## Editing it yourself

You can make small changes right on github.com: open a file, click the pencil icon, edit, then
**Commit changes** (commit directly to `main`). The Build ROM run starts on its own.
If a build fails, the run shows a red X; open it to see the error, or just ask Claude.

### Dialogue

Each map's text lives in `data/maps/<MapName>/scripts.inc`, near the bottom, like this:

```
PalletTown_ProfessorOaksLab_Text_ThoseArePokeBalls::
	.string "A shelf packed with POKé BALLS.\n"
	.string "They hold POKéMON of every type!$"
```

- Change only the text inside the quotes. Keep the label line (ending in `::`) as is.
- `\n` = second line of the box, `\l` = scroll to a new line, `\p` = new text box,
  `$` = end of the message (must be on the last line).
- A line holds about 34 characters. Longer lines run off the edge of the box.
- `{PLAYER}` and `{RIVAL}` insert names; `{STR_VAR_1}` etc. are filled in by the game.
- Use GitHub's search (press `/` in the repo) to find a line you saw in the game.
  The game writes most names in caps (POKéMON, PROF. OAK), so search for the exact wording.

### Trainers

- The rival's teams: `src/data/rival_teams_frlg.party` (one entry per stage per type, e.g.
  `RIVAL_TEAM_CERULEAN_WATER`). Change species, levels, held items (`Squirtle @ Oran Berry`),
  or add moves on lines starting with `- `. Without moves, a Pokémon uses its normal level-up moves.
- Every other trainer: `src/data/trainers_frlg.party`, same format.

## Design decisions

- **Modern typings** (Fairy included). 17 selectable types; Flying is excluded because no Gen 1-3
  Pokémon has Flying as its primary type.
- **Primary type** means `gSpeciesInfo[species].types[0]`.
- The player's type is stored in `VAR_PLAYER_TYPE` (0x40F7) as a `TYPE_*` constant; 0 = not chosen yet.
- **Rival** specializes in a type that is super effective against the player's (table in
  `src/gym_hack.c`), stored in `VAR_RIVAL_TYPE` (0x40F8). His starter is the starter for his type.
  The original rival battles are left in the scripts; `GetTrainerStructFromId` swaps in his
  type-specialist team at battle time (`GymHack_GetRivalTrainer`).
  12 types are possible rival types. Steel and Ice borrow one line each from a secondary
  type (Magnemite/Magneton, Lapras), because those types have too few non-legendary lines.
- **Oak's lab**: the three-ball table is replaced by two shelves of Poké Balls (new art in the lab
  tileset, palette 09). Checking the shelf opens the type menu.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/gym_hack.c`, `include/gym_hack.h` | Hack logic: starter and rival tables, specials, rival team swap |
| `src/data/rival_teams_frlg.party` | The rival's teams |
| `test/gym_hack.c` | Automated tests (`make check BUILD=firered TESTS="GymHack"`) |
| `data/maps/PalletTown_ProfessorOaksLab_Frlg/` | Oak's lab: type menu, shelf, rival's pick |
| `tools/gym_hack/` | Helper scripts: map preview renderer, rival team generator, shelf art |
| `.github/workflows/build-rom.yml` | Automatic ROM builds |

## Roadmap

1. [x] Source build, debug menu
2. Type identity
   - [x] 17-starter type selection in Oak's lab (Poké Ball shelf)
   - [x] Rival specializes in a counter type
   - [ ] Type + no-duplicates check for gym, rival and Elite Four battles
3. [ ] Evolution toggle per Pokémon (no held item); HMs as key items
4. [ ] All 386 Pokémon in the wild; type finder (DexNav-based)
5. [ ] Gym builder and challengers
